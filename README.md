# Lab_4
// This is a class called Population that stores current population, 
// annual number of births, and an annual number of deaths for some geographic area 

// 1) You need to pass the values as parameters to the overloaded constructor AFTER you get the values from the user:
// Population pop1(population, births, deaths);     -3

// 2) Also when you did your division in getbirthrate and getdeathrate, you lost precision. If you static cast one of the operands to 
// double before division.  
// return static_cast (deaths)/ population;   -2
